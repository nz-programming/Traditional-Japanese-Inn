## Website - Traditional Japanese Inn
This website is for the practice of front-end web technology, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
This traditional Japanese Inn is fictional and I wrote this code based on an already-made comprehensive layout.
I made this without a framework or library except for jQuery as much as possible so that I can adjust the detail.
